They are located at Fawcett Lake East resort. 5 or 6 residents supposedly saw a funnel cloud, no pictures were received of said funnel cloud. Damage reports included multiple fallen trees - mostly uprooted though some were snapped. The snapped trees were healthy poplars and some spruce trees. <name1> noted that the damage appeared to follow a definite path. Other damage reports included sheds destroyed, trailer roofs ripped off, tin roofs carried about a kilometer, trailers moved or tipped, and a shed lofted and carried about 150 feet. One family was inside one of the trailers that was tipped and a child was injured - very minor though, no hospital visit needed. Only pea sized hail was reported with the storm. Trees fell in different directions apparently, and much damage to sheds and trailers came from trees falling on top of them. Some RV trailers were reported to have lifted and moved slightly. As of now, it is being recorded as POSSIBLE tornado, but not confirmed. Meteorological circumstances were not indicative of a tornado at the time, however a landspout could be possible. For more information, refer to <name3> - <email1>. Pictures of damage are saved.
